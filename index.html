						<p>I enjoy working on interesting applications of mathematics that have potential to be very impactful and I am currently doing so as a Research Engineer at Google DeepMind.</p>
						<p>In my teenage years, I learned about artificial intelligence, theoretical computer science and mathematics through online university courses (Coursera, edX, etc.). Doing this opened up a lot of opportunities to me, such as gaining work experience in tech companies during high school and coming to the University of Oxford to study a BA in Mathematics and Computer Science (2020-23) with a full scholarship for a academic achievement.</p>
						<p>Here you can find a summary of the things I have worked on, which I'll hopefully keep up to date :)</p>

					        Modelled different clients' data to help them understand their customers' behaviours better, mainly spending my time on the predition of customer journeys through websites. Also had the chance to work more on the engineering side developing a pipeline for graph data using Spark, improving on the alternative in terms of speed by several orders of magnitude.

			<h3 style="padding-left: 10px;">OIFem</h3>
			<p>During my time in high school, when I competed regularly in informatics olympiads, I noticed a very large gender gap, where girls usually made up under 5% of participants. This motivated me to co-found the Spanish Informatics Olympiad for Girls (<a href="https://oifem.es">OIFem</a>), a non-profit with the desire to help teenage girls in Spain find their path in computer science and discover opportunities in the tech world. Every year, OIFem trains students (offering classes from beginner-level programming courses to focused groups on international olympiads), selects the Spanish delegation for <a href="https://egoi.org/">EGOI</a> through a national competition it organises and creates a community of girls who enjoy programming through talks and other social events. All work in OIFem is done by volunteers, many of which are students from previous generations that, once they graduate from high school, join the organisation to give future students an even better experience than the one they lived.</p>
			<p>I chaired this organisation from its creation in 2020 until the end of 2023. I am insanely proud of what we achieved and it exceeded all the expectations that I had when we started. We quite quickly went from barely seeing any girls competing in Spanish informatics olympiads to having hundreds of students and very strong support from sponsors and collaborators. I learned so much in this time, where I had the chance to lead a team of around 30 very passionate competitive programmers working together to give these students the best possible experience. I also did a lot of IC work, from teaching students from all levels to designing challenging problems for them and negotiating with stakeholders.</p>
			<p>After nearly 4 years of running the organisation, I decided to stepped aside to let a team of students from our first editions take charge. In this time, leaderboards of programming competitions in Spain have gone from having the rare appearance of a girl to now almost always having several OIFem girls in them. There have been more medals earned by women in mixed competitions in Spain since the non-profit's creation (2020-2024) than in all previous olympiads (1997-2020) and three OIFem students were the first women's team to ever win HP Codewars Spain. Our students are also excelling in the international stages too, winning medals representing Spain in mixed competitions such as the West European Informatics Olympiad (WEOI) and in the Iberoamerican Informatics Olympiad (OII / CIIC). I now take up occasional technical tasks to help out the new OIFem team and to keep in touch with an organisation that means so much to me.</p>
